### Project management

I have decomposed this project into multiple key tasks, and plotted them on a
Kanban board (Trello).

## 2. Development

* I've used multiple design patterns in my work, which create a better overall
  structure for the program.
* This includes: bitwise manipulation, finite state automata (`GameMode`), and super
  basic artificial intelligence.
* Regular code check-ins and self-review can be seen by observing the `git log`
  command's output.
* Manual testing has been used, but automated tests are difficult to implement with
  Repl.It, so I didn't use those. In future, this would be a better path, though
  tests are admittedly not used very often in the game development world outside of
  core engine tech.
* I've used my Trello board to observe, document and triage bugs/tasks.
